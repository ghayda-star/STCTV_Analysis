STUDY AND ANALYZE USER BEHAVIOR:

       HD   |  SD
Series 55%  |  44%
Movie  35%  |  64%

In My analysis, viewers using HD tend to prefer movies, while SD is more popular among series enthusiasts. Users leaning towards longer content (series) opt for SD to conserve data. Alternatively, series may not always be available in HD.


BUILDING A MODEL TO PREDICT USER BEHAVIOR:

Using 2018 data, we can infer a decreasing trend in STC's total watch time. Possible reasons for this decline could include changes in content preferences, increased competition, or shifts in viewer behavior. To address this, STC may consider diversifying content, enhancing the user interface, or implementing targeted marketing strategies to re-engage and attract viewers.


PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS:

Based on users' previous views, we offer personalized recommendations for movies aligned with their personal interests. This ensures a more thrilling viewing experience, encouraging users to spend more time on STC TV.
